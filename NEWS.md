# simts 0.1.0

## Features

This R package provides a series of tools to simulate, plot, estimate, select and forecast different time series models. More specifically, it provides the following features:

- Simulation of time series from SARIMA models to various state-space models that can be expressed as latent time series processes.
- Visualization of time series data with user specifications.
- Specific simulation and visualization tools for latent time series models.
- Easy-to-use functions to estimate and infer on the parameters of time series models through different methods.
- Diagnostic and statistical tools to assess goodness of fit and select the best model for the data.
- Estimating and plotting tools to deliver point forecasts and confidence intervals.
